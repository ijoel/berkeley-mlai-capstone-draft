# Xerces Society Western Monarch Count Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Xerces Society Western Monarch Count data spanning from 1997 to 2024. The dataset contains monarch butterfly count data from various monitoring sites across the western United States, providing valuable insights into monarch population trends over nearly three decades.

## Analysis Overview
This notebook provides an analysis of Western Monarch butterfly overwintering data using statistics and machine learning techniques. We analyze three distinct datasets:

1. **Sites Dataset**: Geographic and site characteristics
2. **Counts Dataset**: Butterfly observation counts over time
3. **Joined Dataset**: Combined sites and counts for comprehensive analysis

## Objectives
- Implement and compare multiple ML algorithms
- Perform hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV
- Perform model comparison and metrics evaluation

## Notebook
All analysis and modeling steps are documented in [Western_Monarch_Counts_EDA.ipynb](Western_Monarch_Counts_EDA.ipynb).
